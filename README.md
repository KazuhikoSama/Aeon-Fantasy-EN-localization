# AeonFantasyENLOC
This project attempts to make the experience of playing Aeon Fantasy much more enjoyable by translating many elements of the game to English.
*Disclaimer*: I do not take credit for any of the game resourse files, content, music or assets in general, this only modifies the localization file in which the languages are set.

#How to install
-Navigate to your game install directory, it should be under: Android/data/com.dff.rppprd/files/Assets/Data
-Create a backup of the file "Localization.csv"
-Copy and paste the translated localization file into this directory
-Launch the game

Patch translates:
-Almost all UI content
-Skill, talents, potentials, almost all done
-Items, items description

Not translated:
-Story content

Story content is located in another file which I haven't been able to locate yet so if you're interested in this
I suggest you used any screen translator app like Tap to translate.
