# AeonFantasyENLOC
******---->>>> THIS MOD WORKS ONLY FOR ANDROID <<<<----******  
This project attempts to make the experience of playing Aeon Fantasy much more enjoyable by translating many elements of the game to English.  

#  Disclaimer: 
I do not take credit for any of the game resourse files, content, music or assets in general nor this project is associated in any way to the developer.
This tool provides only a modification for the localization file and it against TOS, proceed at your own risk.
  
#  How to install  
-Navigate to your game install directory, it should be under: Android/data/com.dff.rppprd/files/Assets/Data  
-Create a backup of the file "Localization.csv" inside (just rename to localization2.csv or something and move it somewhere else from the Data folder outside the game files folder)  
-Copy and paste the translated localization file from this git into this directory Android/data/com.dff.rppprd/files/Assets/Data  
-Launch the game  
  
Patch translates:  
-Almost all UI content  
-Skill, talents, potentials, almost all done  
-Items, items description  
-Almost all Guild related stuff   
-Character stats, Quests, Achievements, etc
  
Not translated:  
-Story content  

Story content is located in another file which I haven't been able to locate yet so if you're interested in this
I suggest you used any screen translator app like Tap to translate.


# Issues  

If you find any issues please make sure to specify which part of the game or attach a picture as some of the translations tend to repeat but not all text boxes sizes are equal, so is very common to find text that overflows of the screen or cuts.
